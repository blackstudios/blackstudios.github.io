							<h2>The First Post (W1-W3)</h2>
							<small>Posted Oct 12th, 2017 by <strong>Sohiel</strong> </small>
						</div>
						<div class ="row" id="post_content">
							<p>Welcome to our Devblog and hopefully you are interested in our project. With this being our first post i will be talking about what we have done if the first three weeks of our project.In the first week we all had met up for the first time. We had discussed what kind of atmosphere we wanted within our group in which was a relaxed and positive atmosphere in which the members were comfortable in talking to each other. Within this first week was also allocated everyone a task that we all shall fulfill each week whenever we had met up to do meeting and discussions. Mine personally was to be the team relectionist by discussing and addressing where the team might be lacking as well as adjusting accordingly.</p>
							
							<p>In Week 2 it was mainly about the pitch that we had to do for our module but before we could have done the pitch only 3 members of the group had played the game Risk. So to get everyone on the same boat we had played the game risk. By the end of the week everyone was able to play the game and had a good understanding of how the game works and had some idea of how we were going to create and implement the game onto a computer.</p>
							
							<p>In Week 3 now that we had a better understanding of how the game actually works we started to think about what we were going to implement. We didn't want to make an exact copy of risk so we decided instead of the normal risk where you are on earth we decided to make our game based in space. This allowed for more expansion in which we believe were going to make our game unique and interesting by adding easter eggs and other game mechanics in which the original version of risk didn't have. We also had decided that we were going to use Unity to make our game as Unity has some preexisting game physics which would save us a lot of time.
							</p>
							
							<p>Finally in Week 3 we had decided in what roles each member officially had. We all based everyones role from their strengths and weakness by analyzing and discussing with each other in which roles we were willing to accept and carryout while we were working on our project. Mine personally to be one of the four programmers along with Pedro, Sulaiman and Taz. </p>

							<h2>The Learning Stage (W5)</h2>
							<small>Posted Oct 29th, 2017 by <strong>Mujtaba</strong> </small>
						</div>
						<div class ="row" id="post_content">
							<p>We used this week to learn how to use the tools we needed. Pedro, Soheil, Sulaiman, and Taz focused on learning how to develop in Unity. Hassan, Mital, Taimoor, and I focused on learning how to model in Blender. We used tutorials provided by the company or some we found on YouTube to see how we could use the programs to make the game. We found that developing the models in unity and later animating them in unity would be easier than creating them in Blender.</p>

							<h2>Planning for the Hack (W6-W7)</h2>
							<small>Posted Nov 10th, 2017 by <strong>Mujtaba</strong> </small>
						</div>
						<div class ="row" id="post_content">
							<p>We decided which features were necessary for the hack and which we would save for the MVP and definitive version. We decided upon three territories because that was the minimum we needed to show attacking and defending. The troops would be a basic model that would be coloured differently to signify each team.</p>

							<p>Then we set out to create the hack. We completed this in Unity, except for the hexes for each territory, which were developed in Blender. The territories were textured with some resources we found online. We implemented the attacking and defending for each territory with little to no problems.</p>

							<p>We also worked on the project plan that outlined how we were working as a team and what we hoped the project would progress like. We based it upon how fast we thought we could use unity to develop the game and how much time we could give to this project over the other modules. The plans seemed ambitious but achievable.</p>

							<h2>The MVP (W8-W12)</h2>
							<small>Posted Dec 12th, 2017 by <strong>Mujtaba</strong> </small>
						</div>
						<div class ="row" id="post_content">
							<p>After the hack and project plan were complete, we could focus on implementing the features we needed for the MVP and refining the features we already had implemented. We decided the main feature we would add would be the physics-based dice roll since we were unsure how to balance the commando unit and the resources at this stage of development.</p>

							<p>We added significantly more territories to the game as well as the jump stations feature. We cleaned up the UI and improved some of the textures. We implemented the physics-based dice roll to look like someone threw the dice. We added menus to the game where you could start/quit the game. In the start menu you could select your team and the number of troops every territory starts with. We improved the controls with better camera movement.</p>

							<p>On week 12 we presented the game to the other teams and the lecturers and got a positive response. Many liked the inclusion of the physics dice roll and appreciated the graphics. The game worked as it should, and Pedro recorded scenarios that the game can be in to speed up the presentation, while showing the game works. We saw other teams that also recreated risk and had some interesting ideas that we could consider implementing.</p>

							<h2>Planning for  the Final Game (W13-16)</h2>
							<small>Posted Feb 1st, 2018 by <strong>Taz</strong> </small>
						</div>
						<div class ="row" id="post_content">
							<p>With the MVP done and the reviews given we finally found out what we were competing with. Within the MVP we found out that there were many other groups who we also doing a game based of Risk just like us. Taking this into account and how the other teams versions of risk were looking we were quite surprised with the amount of detail and time some group have given into their game, so we too had to step up our game.</p>

							<p>Taking this into account we had decided on what features we were going to impletement into the game as well as who will be doing these specified tasks. We decided that our game needed a better User Interface, A Currency system, Ship models and animation, Sounds and many more other features. The User Interface task was assigned to me, The Currency system was assigned to Pedro, Ship Models assigned to Mujtaba, Animations and Sounds to Sohiel.</p>

							<h2>Onwards to the Final Game (W17-W21)</h2>
							<small>Posted Mar 1st, 2018 by <strong>Hassan</strong> </small>
						</div>
						<div class ="row" id="post_content">
							<p>Within these few weeks we had encountered out first real issue. This issue was based of the version control system that we were using. Unity provides a version control system which is quite easy to use and easy to link other team members to your project. This was one of the main reasons why we chose Unity as it allowed us to work together without having to use another medium of version control.</p>

							<p>Due to this being a 3rd party software we were unaware of the changes that would happen with Unity's version control system and this soon became an issue with us. Unity changed their version control system to where only 3 people at max can use the version control system at a time. Before you could of had many more. Due to this majority of the team wasnt able to join which cause a bit of an issue as now we had to keep reassiging seats from one team member to another.</p>

							<p>Inspite of all the problems that had occurs we were able to do the following: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Models of commando units complete and their associated resources</li>
								<li>Added textures to the units</li>
								<li>Completed the main menu screen which is loaded prior to the end</li>
								<li>Menu also saves settings from previous use</li>
								<li>Added resources into the game which will be used to purchase troops next week, hopefully</li>
								<li>The addition of scripts to allow commando units to called into a fight and to move from and to different territories</li>
								<li>Added the animation for the moving of the ships</li>
								<li>Finally added an arrow above the selected territory so you know which territory is being selected</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>The Final Game (W22-24)</h2>
							<small>Posted Mar 23rd, 2017 by <strong>Pedro</strong> </small>
						</div>
						<div class ="row" id="post_content">
							<p>After all the long hours and stressfull coding, the game is finally done. From territories to ship animations to UI to models its all done. We unfortunatly coulding implement all of the features that we had wished as we didnt anticicpate how long it would of taken to implement the other features as well. Some of the features that we had to miss out was the entrench system as well as the game sound effects as these would have taken too long to produce for the final game.</p>

							<p>The game came out quite well and when it came to our final presentation this too went quite well. We might have not have added everything we had wanted but it was a good effort from all of the team members. I believe that we worked quite well with one another even when times got quite tough and stressfull but we all kept it cool and helped each other out when time came to the worst.</p>
